# Blackjack Project

### Description

This application is a single-player game of Blackjack.

After the initial hand is dealt, the user choose to `hit` or `stay`.

- If the user's hand equals `21`, the user wins.
- If the user's hand exceeds `21`, the user busts and loses.

The player with the highest score without busting wins.

##### Running the program:
```
- Import project into Eclipse
- Compile and run main in `BlackjackApp.java`
```

- Enumerations help control allowable data and provide additional information

### Technologies Used
